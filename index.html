            8/21 - 8/24 Week 1 -- This week I learned how to use AWS and Github to code a website. 
            The class created accounts to start coding, and pasted all our website links in one Google Sheet to make it accessable. 
            I reviwed HTML code such as "br" to make a space, "p" to make a paragraph, "b1,b2" etc. to make text sizes, and "heading" and "title." 
            In AWS, we write a weekly journal based on what we have done that week, and use git add *, git commit -m, and git push in a terminal in order to save it into our website.
            On the 24th of August we did a class project that involved attempting to transport a marble by aligning pipes until it reached the cup on the floor.

            8/28 - 8/31 Week 2 -- This week I learned about Mechanical Engineering. 
            This is a form of engineering that consists of mathematics, physics, drafting, manufacturing, thermodynamics, material science, fluid mechanics, and structural analysis.
            I learned what a Rude Goldberg machine is, which consist of wheel and axels, levers, pullys, inclined planes, wedges, and screws. 
            The main focus of attempting to learn mechanical engineering was Tinkercad, which is essential drafting and designing.
            We learned how to make shapes, combine, align, rotate, move, and make holes in them.
            As a challenge this week, we made our option of a home appliance in Tinkercad to test our skills. 
            I made a roll of toilet paper using cylinders.

            9/4 - 9/7 Week 3 -- This week we used Tinkercad to help make a design that utilizes a pulley, inclined plane, and a wheel and axle.
            The point of the whole project is to originally start with a baseball, that eventually starts a cycle that pops a baloon.
            We shared the plane with all our groupmates, and we all worked to create something that was to scale and seemed to work. 
            In Tinkercard, we used settings to change grid sizes and align and group tools to create desired shapes.
            Towards the end of the week, we started to use the design as a reference to real life.
            Using materials such as hardboard, cardboard, tape, and box cutters we developed a foundation for our design.

            <h3>8/20 - 8/26 Week 1</h3>
            This week I learned how to use AWS and Github to code a website. 
            The class created accounts to start coding, and pasted all our website links in one Google Sheet to make it accessable. 
            I reviwed HTML code such as "br" to make a space, "p" to make a paragraph, "b1,b2" etc. to make text sizes, and "heading" and "title." 
            In AWS, we write a weekly journal based on what we have done that week, and use git add *, git commit -m, and git push in a terminal in order to save it into our website.
            On the 24th of August we did a class project that involved attempting to transport a marble by aligning pipes until it reached the cup on the floor. 
            We eventually completed the challenge, by starting the rout as high as possible, and keeping the marble at a stable speed.

            <h3>8/27 - 9/2 Week 2</h3>
            This week I learned about Mechanical Engineering. 
            This is a form of engineering that consists of mathematics, physics, drafting, manufacturing, thermodynamics, material science, fluid mechanics, and structural analysis.
            I learned what a Rude Goldberg machine is, which consist of wheel and axels, levers, pullys, inclined planes, wedges, and screws. 
            The main focus of attempting to learn mechanical engineering was Tinkercad, which is essential drafting and designing.
            We learned how to make shapes, combine, align, rotate, move, and make holes in them.
            As a challenge this week, we made our option of a home appliance in Tinkercad to test our skills. 
            I made a roll of toilet paper using cylinders.

            <h3>9/3 - 9/9 Week 3</h3>
            This week we used Tinkercad to help make a design that utilizes a pulley, inclined plane, and a wheel and axle.
            The point of the whole project is to originally start with a baseball, that eventually starts a cycle that pops a baloon.
            We shared the plane with all our groupmates, and we all worked to create something that was to scale and seemed to work. 
            In Tinkercad, we used settings to change grid sizes and align and group tools to create desired shapes.
            Towards the end of the week, we started to use the design as a reference to real life.
            Using materials such as hardboard, cardboard, tape, and box cutters we developed a foundation for our design.

            <h3>9/10 - 9/16 Week 4</h3>
            This week we spent most of our time finishing the Rude Goldberg project. 
            We used Tinkercad throughout our class in order to calculate dimensions. 
            Using cardboard and tape, we made box-like structures in order to maintain a stable base.
            Me and my team made the pulley that we were using to transfer movement from the ball to the car, by carefully balancing a stack of cardboard on a beam.
            At first it was too flimsy, so we added more tape to make sure it could hold the baseball's weight. 
            After the pulley would move upwards, it would ascend a wall that would allow a needle attached to a toy car to roll down a ramp and
            pop the baloon.

            <h3>9/17 - 9/23 Week 5</h3>
            This week we completed two engineering challenges. 
            One was the engineering "E". 
            In this challenge, we individually drew the letter E on the paper, everyone labeled theirs with different lengths and shapes.
            After we finished, we swapped E's with another classmate and tried to recreate their "E" on a blank paper using only the measurements provided.
            This challenge made us learn the importance of measuring properly and labeling accurately.
            Our second challenge was creating a paper boat.
            This paper boat was only made of paper and tape, and could only be designed in ten minutes.
            We all chose a weight we thought our boat could withstand and put it to the test by letting it float in water for five minutes.
            My boat successfully held 27 kgs of weight for the full time.

            <h3>9/25 - 9/29 Week 6</h3>
            This week we took apart a computer.
            We started with removing parts of the computer by followign a slide with step by step directions.
            As we disesembled the computer and its parts, my partner and I captured photos in order to remember the location of specific parts.
            After everything was removed, we screwed and added the parts back together.
            Lastly, we colored a worksheet that represented the computer parts, and plugged in the computer to see if it worked.

            <h3>10/2 - 10/6 Week 7</h3>
            This week we went over bioengineering.
            Me and my partner were challenged with making a prosthetic arm using only cardboard, tape, and string.
            We made a sketch, and settled on a design that fit on a working hand and moved accordingly to the fingers.
            To do this, each finger was sorrounded by a ring, connected to a string that would pull or release.
            At first, it didn't grip very well, but we added deeper ridges in the fingers and tighter strings to help.
            In the end, we completed the challenge by grabbing and lifting a plastic bottle using the prothetic arm.
            Also, I created a prosthetic leg for an animal in Tinkercad by using different shapes to create toes, joints, and chambers.

            <h3>10/9 - 10/13 Week 8</h3>
            This week we covered aerospace engineering.
            we learned about the forces on aircrafts which are, weight, thrust, lift, and drag.
            In class, we individually designed our own aircrafts in Tinkercad.
            I made a rocketship that was to scale of a two liter bottle.
            It included four long fins that will assist the bottle to fly further.
            I also added a cone shape design at the top of the bottle to make it more aerodynamic.
            Next week, the class will compete to see who will have the highest fying rocket bottle.

            <h3>10/16 - 10/20 Week 9</h3>
            This week we finished building and tested our rocket bottles.
            We added support to the wings using a hot glue gun to maintain balance and direction.
            On the field where we tested the planes, the bottles were filled with pressure and water, and were sent off to fly.
            We chose to fill our glider with about 70 psi of pressure, and 2 cups of water.
            Our bottle flipped in the air and landed about 5 yards away from launch, about average distance compard with others.
            If me and my partner did this again, we would apply more of a missile design and use less pressure when launching.

            <h3>10/23 - 10/27 Week 10</h3>
            This week we learned about environmental engineering.
            It includes controlling air polluton, water quality, wastes, and other forms of pollution and safety hazards.
            Our class did a water clarification project, where we added black water to a soda bottle that filtered through rocks, sand, cotton balls, and pebbles.
            Me and my partner decided to add tne cotton balls towards the bottom, then worked upwards with sand, pebbles, and rocks.
            We poured the black water with wood and dirt in it, into the bottle and watched it filter out.
            This process was repeated unitl we got a semi-clear, yellow water.

           <h3>10/30 - 11/3 Week 11</h3>
           This week we began our electrical engineering unit.
           learned about voltage, current, resistance, and power.
           We used equations such as V=IR, to calculate measures of elctricity in circuits.
           Paralell circuits are one big circle of power, while series circuits are mamny seperate loops.
           We used Tinkercad to assemble paralell and series circuits using a breadboard, LEDs, resistors, and wires.

            <h3>11/6 - 11/10 Week 12</h3>
            This week we started to assemble circuits on breadboards.
            We used an Arduino to power or circuit, and were also given resistors, wires, and colored LEDs to make parallel and series circuit.
            We attemted to make a one-light circuit, series circuit (3LED), and a parallel circuit (3LED). 
            For a long time it was very confusing why our LEDs were not flashing, but eventually we moved wires into the right spots and made sure all the LEDs had working diodes.
            Me and my partner even experiented with different color LEDs and putting wires in different spots.

            <h3>11/13 - 11/17 Week 13</h3>
            This week we started learning about business engineering. 
            We studied the waterfall method which is a method of prject management that is in the order of requirements, design, implementation, testing, and deployement and maintenance.
            We also learned about a Kanban Board and UI and UX in marketing.
            Later in this week, we formed groups and brainstormed for an idea to present as a Shark Tank pitch.
            We origninally thought of an ice cream drip resistance cone, but thought it would be a hard idea to expand on and sell.
            Instead, we stayed in the food sector, but shifted to thinking of a product that would kepp hot foods warm, like a reheatable spoon.

            <h3>11/27 - 12/1 Week 14</h3>
            This week we started working on a Shark Tank presentation as a group project.
            While we were brainstorming, we thought it would be cool to create a product that kept hot foods warm and could heat them up quickly and efficiently.
            This was a shift from our first idea of a drip-resistance ice cream cone.
            We researched to make their weren't to many similar products, then started to fill out google slides.
            We added the problem we were trying to solve, our distribution and manufacturing, sales, cost, future goals, and final offer.
            We thought ours was the most complete presentation (:

            <h3>Week 15</h3>
    1. What was the weight of your bridge?
    Our best bridge weighed 46 grams.
    <br>
    2. What was the weight held by your bridge?
    Our best bridge held 2035 grams of water.
    <br>
    3. What was the ratio of weight of bridge to weight held?
    The ratio of our best bridge was 44; it held 44 times of its own weight.
    <br>
    4. What was the heaviest part of your bridge? What contributed most to the weight?
    The base of our bridge was the heaviest part, and contributed most to the weight.
    <br>
    5. Where did the design of your bridge come from? Inspiration? Research?
    The design of our bridge was inspired by the triangle architecture that is seen in many bridges.
    The trusses are a type of framework that we researched that keeps bridges very stable.
    <br>
    6. Did the design work as intended? Better? Worse?
    The design did work as intended, nothing unexpected snapped.
    Our bridge placed third best in terms of ratio of weight to weight held.
    The trusses and overall design seemed to hold the bucket of water whilst being stable abd strong, and was flexable when challenged with more weight.
    <br>
    7. What was the point of failure of your bridge? Was that the expected weakest point?
    The point of failure was on one edge of the bridge.
    This was not entirely expected, because this means that something on that side was loose, not glued properly, or not supported thoroughly.
    <br>
    8. What can you do to improve your bridge? What can prolong points of failure?
    We could have improved the parts of the bridge that are only held by one strand of spaghetti were particullarly vulnerable because they have to handle more pressure single-handedly.
    We could have cut more smaller strands of spaghetti and glue it to connect and strengthen parts of the bridge that are only held together by one piece.
    <br>
    9. Post building progress photos of your bridge
    EMAIL
    <br>
    10. Post photos of before your bridge (many photos)
    EMAIL
    <br>
    11. Post a video of your bridge

         <h3>1/8 - 1/12 S2 Week 1</h3>
         This week we learned about Chemical Engineering.
         Part of their job is ensuring compliance with health, safety, and environmental regulations
         Also conducting research to improve manufacturing processes and designing and planning equipment layout
         Processes such as metallurgy, microfluidics, mineral processing, molecular engineering, gas processing, nuclear reprocessing, and oil exploration are involved with chemical engineers.
         Our project this week was to create a liquid called oobleck.
         The most important thing while conducting this experiment was to manage the mixture of starch and water accordingly and in the right amounts.
         If the mixture became too thick, we added water, and as it became hard we added more water to balance out the texture.

         <h3>1/15 - 1/19 S2 Week 2</h3>
         This week we started on a big project based on constructing a mousetrap car.
         The goal is for the car to travel in a straight line and to drive as far as possible.
         This is done by saving energy and finding the best ratios for your mousetrap car.
         We did some research, and me and my partner used information from websites and many videos with helpful notes.
         We filled out a proposal with all the information, and things we learned from the video like how certain ratios were important, and aspects like reducing fricting in axels and finding the correct wheel size and release speed.

        <h3>1/22 - 1/26 S2 Week 3</h3>
        This week we dove deeper into our mousetrap car project.
        We learned more about what a mousetrap car should look like, and how to implement positive things onto our car.
        We used calculations on our ratio, and predicted distance based on wheel size.
        Using our Tinkercad design to guide us, my partner and I collected materials we needed such as straws, wood, cardboard, CDs, and tools to build.
        After our preperation week this week, we plan to start cutting the car body, and attaching the axels to the wheels as our first step.

        <h3>S2 Week 4</h3>
        This week was mainly a building week for everyone to get there cars done.
        With both me and my partner being absent at times in this week, we had to communicate to ensure we completed all our tasks.
        We both set our individual goals and executed them, and talked about what we are doing and plan to do so there was no confusion or surpirse.
        In terms of buliding, we measured our body and other dimensions of car parts by ruler, and comparing them to the Tinkercad.
        Parts like the mousetrap, axels, wheels, excess cardboard, string, tape, and glue were added.
        Most of our time and effort was spent on the wheels and axels, and attempting to make them straight and secure.
        We tried this by reducing the axel's movement, and maintain stability between the axel and wheel with tape to optimize accuracy.
        Overall, the car wasn't exactly what we hoped for, but it was at least drving fairly well.
        Our plans next were to learm how to wind the string and release the mousetrap so the car can reach its potential, and also to finsih up any last second additions or reinforcements.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <h3>S2 Week 5-6</h3>
        1. The many flaws in our first prototype included loose wheels, folded cardboard, and unefficent body.
           The loose wheels caused for a loss of energy, as they were not moving straight and were wobbly
           The folded carboard, that bended when the car accelertaed, had to be solved with excess weight and overall restricted the car from acheiving its maximum distance.
           The unefficent body resulted in inaccurate direction and more cardboard to carry.
           <br>
        2. In our second design we planned to improve some obvious issues we encountered while building and testing our first car.
           First, we changed the carboard body to be much smaller, this way the car could travel farther and we could control the accuracy better.
           Next, we changed the wheels to be attached to the axel with hot glue instead of tape.
           This solved our problem of unstable wheels that restricted the car from moving straight.
           Last, we made sure our cardboard did not fold while building or testing, and we made sure of it by adding some support in places that had a lot of pressure.
           <br>
        3. Our measured distance of our first design was 35 feet.
        <br>
        4. The percent error was 11.4%
        <br>
        5. So far we have made a prototype of our car based on our Tinkercad and sketches.
           We made adjustements and additions during building, and the final length of our test was around 37 feet.
           Now, we are making plans and designs for methods to improve our last design and work more efficiently.
        <br>
        6. The next steps of our porject are to gather new materials and discuss how we are going to execute our new ideas and improvemets.
           
           
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <h3>S2 Week 7</h3>
        Our testing this week went fairly good.
        Our goal based on ou calculations at the start of the project was for our car to travel about 39 feet
        We reached 40 feet on our last run which was 5 feet longer than the distance of our first prototype.
        The car was inconsistent, going straight sometimes, and turning sometimes, but we were surprised how fast it moved.
        If my partner and I were to improve our car we would reinforce the rod on the mousetrap.
        The rod was unstable and leaned while the car was moving because it was not strong enough.
        Another thing was the wheels; although the wheels were many times better than from the first prototype due to using hot glue, they were still loose.
        We would have realigned the wheels and hot glued them for a second time to ensure the wheels were not contributing to the car not driving straight.

        <h3>S2 Week 8</h3>
        This week we started the well-known egg-drop competition.
        With my partner, we both sketched blueprints for our design, and then settled on a general design.
        We made a Tinkercad that accurately represented the dimensions of what we wanted to create.
        Our design included a trash bag parashute, strings connected to a baloon full of cotton balls and straws containing the baloon, and another baloon below the first one to reduce impact.
        We finished most of the design, thanks to the Tinkercad to refer to and also quickly executing new ideas that we had.
        This week we also did a doors vs. wheels challenge.
        My group had to prove why there was more wheels than doors and how much there was on our campus.
        We defined wheels as anything that rotated on an axel, so we included door axels, car wheels, printer wheels, drawer wheels, project wheels, mechanism wheels, and more.
        We added these numbers up to around 20,000 wheels on campus, judging by all the doors that all have axels (3x), and all the cars we observed on the parking lots.

        <h3>S2 Week 11</h3>
        This week we started the gutter boat challenge.
        We were given a specifc amount og materials we can not exceed, and a very narrow and shallow gutter to propel our boat in.
        We made a Tinkercad for out boat, which is made up primarily of three popsicle sticks, a sail, and propeller.
        The propeller design that we found online is what we thought would be the best, and easiet way to move the boat.
        We had to plan out exactly what we wanted to build, and execute it exactly like we designed it, because of limited materials and time.
        The propeller is made of the last popsicle stick divided into two pieces, and connectd to make an X shape.
        The sail, which we could blow at the start, is held together by a straw, toothpicks, and a tissue.
        Me and my partnr expect our boat to work, as we took into account its dimensions and also if it would tip over, sink, or not move straight in the gutter.
